        <h4 id="input-and-output">input and output</h4>
        <blockquote>
        <p>In techie speak the information stored or shared with the user is called output. Anything coming in from where it was stored or anything the user enters is called input. To techies, input and output are called IO, Input-Output.</p>

        <h4 id="headers">headers</h4>
        <p>i remember in WDD230 class last sem, i learned that headers are not used to create physical hierarchy. they are used to create content hierarchy. very often, the header sizes and styles are changed in the css page. they are mostly used to make selecting easier. </p>
        <h4 id="section-tags">section tags</h4>
        <blockquote>
        <p>section tags fill the screen all the way across. Take advantage of this. Put the buttons inside a section tag. Since the section tag requires the full width of the page, the buttons canâ€™t be on the same line as the two inputs.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>this is something that i didn&#39;t know about the section tags. i wonder if this is the same with the div tags? or is this where they differ?</p>
